Project Description
- Access to counseling services may influence smoking habits and drug experimentation, yet the extent of this impact is not clearly understood. This study aims to investigate whether access to counseling can effectively reduce the prevalence of smoking and drug experimentation, particularly among adolescents, by providing education, support, and healthy coping mechanisms. Identifying the potential barriers to counseling access and addressing the associated stigma are also critical components of this exploration.
